# Tour_Guide_App

This project a Tour Guide app, I made for #UdacityLevelUp. 
This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. For instance, an app focused on Mountain View, CA might include a list of startup headquarters as well as a list of restaurants and a list of parks.

I made multiple screens, each containing a list. You will use a ViewPager plus TabLayout (or Navigation Drawer) combined with Fragments to move between screens.

Next, I filled in those lists with list items, populated using a custom adapter. Some lists include information such as a phone number or business hours, and others have a photographies.
